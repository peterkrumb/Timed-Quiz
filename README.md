# Timed JavaScript Quiz

## For this project I was tasked with building a timed quiz with questions of my choosing, related to javascript or other basic coding knowledge. The application must have features of saving the person's high score, which is pulled from the console's local storage as well as a timer which subtracts seconds upon a wrong answer.

## Questions
For the questions I tried to think of basic yet engaging questions based off material we've covered so far.

## Functions
This quiz relied heavily on functions which would activate at certain points of the quiz process. For instance the timer function activated when you pressed start, the show scores function would activate when the quiz was over, the hide questions element would activate once all questions had been answered, etc.
